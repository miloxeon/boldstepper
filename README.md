Bold Stepper [boʊld ˈstɛpər]:
1. Scroll shooter game about a fat aspiring stand-up comedian turned space cadet
2. My first relatively big coding project

__Disclaimer:__ the code is completely awful, but it will never be improved. It's interesting for me to keep code _frozen_, so I can track my progress.

## Mistakes made
 - Lack of software design skills made me to rewrite the whole game _four times_.
 - I didn't ever knew how to use Git, and some code and resources were lost forever.
 - I was familiar with C and tried to move that imperative experience to declarative ActionScript field.  
The imperative code I've been writing was awful.

## Good parts
 - __It looks _awesome_.__  
High quality code may be your number one priority in real world application, but when it comes to indie games, how the game _feels_ is the king. Games are pieces of art, aren't them?

 - __I've learned a lot.__  
This game and errors I made allowed me to understand the importance of software design over raw, dumb coding. That was probably the most important experience of my life then.
